# Personal-projects

Those are some personal ~silly~ projects I've worked on since I started learning python.

Some of them don't have propper comments or documentation, but feel free to contact me in case you're interested in what I did.

'Texto_Diario.py' is the last one and, even though it's not very complex, I was very proud when it finally worked, because I had struggled and postponed that project many times.
